# Studio workspace routing

This is a multi-repository workspace, not a monorepo. Enter the target repository
and read its root AGENTS.md before work. Each repository's instructions and docs
must remain usable when cloned alone or opened in an isolated worktree.

| Directory | Responsibility | Default branch |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `voice-agent-studio/` | Go/React product, contracts, Helm and release workflows | main |
| `voice-agent-squad/` | Local coordination CLI/MCP/plugin  | main |
| `convoai-studio-importer/` | Independently maintained Python source-to-Studio importer | main |
| `interceptor/` | Go request workflow/forwarding service and companion tools | master |

Do not treat sibling repositories as one Git history, copy credentials between
them, or assume a change to one has updated the others. Use independent branches,
tests and delivery evidence. Preserve unrelated work and active worktrees.

Each repository's AGENTS.md owns portable development rules; topic documents own
architecture and runbooks. Workspace-specific working policy belongs in this
outer file and separately maintained skills, not in product repository documents.
No such policy is configured by this routing template. Keep live task state out
of maintained documentation. Source work does not authorize installation,
shared-environment changes or active-task migration.
